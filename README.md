# TeleGleam

This a TUI that allows uses the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) to make some tasks easier.

## The Motivation

The main thing I wanted to be able to do was to create galleries in Telegram channels and the photos and videos would have captions based on metadate that was already in their files via [exif metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif).

## Development

If you want to work on TeleGleam it's written in the [Gleam programming language](https://gleam-lang.org/) and then compiled to JavaScript.

Setup [devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox)

```sh

# build

# run
